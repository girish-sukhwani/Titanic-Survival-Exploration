## Project: Titanic Survival Exploration

## Project Overview
In this project, we will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex and age. We will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until we are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce some of the concepts of machine learning.

This project contains three files:

- `titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb`: This is the main file containing the code.
- `titanic_data.csv`: The project dataset.
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project.
